Hello Mr. Amulya and balarama 

Greetings for the day !

As Per our previous discussion we are are Designing CICD Pipeline for deploying ML-Model with Docker & Kubernetes 

We have Considered AKS ( Azure Kubernetes Services ) as Kubernetes Service for Deployment kindly Confirm is it Correct or are you using another service for Kubernetes Deployment 

Awaiting for your response
